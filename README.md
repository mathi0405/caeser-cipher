# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Encrypts a message by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
- **Decoding**: Decrypts a message by shifting letters backward in the alphabet.
- **Flexible Input**: Handles messages with both alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters.
- **User-Friendly**: Allows the user to encode or decode multiple messages in a single run.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
### output

Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
5
Here is the encoded result: mjqqt
